Hello there!

Thank you for checking my project! As this is a Hardware based emulation project, the technical experimentation was done on external websites and applications.
Here is the link to the Tinkered projects as showcased in the video:

Motivation:
The accompanying video to this project is a an understanding and look at the possible use cases, techniques and approaches towards the Hardware Implementation of Random Number Generation.

Research: Multiple Circuit guides, discussions and forum threads were looked at for inspiration and understanding.

Developement: Due to time constraints and part mismatch/issues on online platforms, there was a hindrance when it came to the demo showcase implementation of any of the techniques discussed.

Thank you! Please reach out to me if any questions.
